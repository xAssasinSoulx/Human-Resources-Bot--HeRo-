# Human Resources Bot (HeRo)

GSoft Sponsor Challenge Winner of CONUHACKS VII

## Revolutionizing Onboarding and Employee Sentiment Tracking

Our HR bot aims to **revolutionize** the onboarding process and employee sentiment tracking within organizations. Through the integration of powerful tools such as _Google Cloud Natural Language API, Calendar API, and Github REST API_, we are able to **streamline** the onboarding process and provide valuable insights into employee sentiment.

We understand that onboarding can be a challenging task for any organization, with a multitude of tasks and information that needs to be gathered and processed. Our bot streamlines this process by **automating repetitive tasks** and providing all the necessary information in one place. Additionally, the integration of sentiment analysis allows managers to stay informed about their employee's satisfaction, engagement, and overall well-being.

The bot has been developed using Python, Flask, and SQLite, ensuring **secure data storage** and a **user-friendly interface**. The bot is compatible with Slack and Discord, two of the most popular communication platforms used in organizations today.

We were inspired by the challenge presented by Gsoft throughout the Hackathon, and believe that our HR bot is a valuable solution that addresses the challenges faced by organizations in onboarding and employee sentiment tracking. With our HR bot, organizations can **improve their onboarding** process and stay informed about employee sentiment, ultimately leading to a more engaged and productive workforce.
